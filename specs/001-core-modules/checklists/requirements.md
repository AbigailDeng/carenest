# Specification Quality Checklist: Wellmate Core Modules

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Module Specifications Quality

- [x] Each module has defined user intent
- [x] Each module has defined inputs
- [x] Each module has defined outputs
- [x] Each module has defined AI responsibilities
- [x] Each module has defined non-goals/constraints
- [x] Each module has defined edge cases

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] All 8 principles addressed in compliance section
- [x] Each module specification aligns with constitution principles
- [x] Disclaimers and safety considerations documented
- [x] Privacy-first architecture reflected in requirements

## Notes

- Specification is comprehensive and ready for planning phase
- All core modules (Health Tracking, Nutrition, Emotional Support, Reminders/Insights, Privacy) are fully specified
- Module specifications include detailed breakdowns of user intent, inputs, outputs, AI responsibilities, constraints, and edge cases
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases are thoroughly documented for each module
- Constitution compliance verified for all modules
